Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect 5.7 million Americans, and are expensive despite the lack of a cure or even treatments effective in managing the disease. The literature thus far has tended to focus on the costs to Medicare, even though one of the main characteristics of ADRD (the loss of independence and ability to care for oneself) incurs costs not covered by Medicare.
